# Particle-Classification-using-python'

The program imports several libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn (sklearn), and reads in a dataset called "pid-5M.csv" using the read_csv method from pandas. The DataFrame is preprocessed by replacing numerical values in the 'id' column with corresponding particle names using the replace method from pandas. Then, the first 500 rows of the preprocessed DataFrame are selected using the head method from pandas. A Decision Tree Classifier model is initialized, and the 'id' column is set as the target variable. The model is then fit to the feature columns of the preprocessed DataFrame. A visualization of the decision tree is exported to a dot file called 'particle.dot' using the export_graphviz method from sklearn. Overall, this program trains a Decision Tree Classifier on particle identification data and visualizes it using a decision tree. However, it is important to note that this program uses only a small subset of the original dataset and does not split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
